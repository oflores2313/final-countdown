# Students

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Getting Started

In order to be able to run this, you will need to open the students-api project and run `npm install` followed by `npm start` . That will open the project on `http://localhost:3001/`

Once that is running, you can run `npm install` followed by `npm start` on this project (students)

## About the project

This application reads in a a list of users from the API and displays them for the user. The user can then select on `View Student Details` to see additional information of the student.

Search functionality is available. However, this is an open bug on this (which if you delete from the search, the data does not re-populate and instead stays the same)

All of the data and manipulation of the data is done in the store, via selectors.
